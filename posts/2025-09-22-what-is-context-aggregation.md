# What is Context Aggregation? A Primer for Developers

Generative AI doesnâ€™t fail because the model is weak. It fails because the **context is missing**.

When an AI tool tries to generate code, review a PR, or suggest a fix, itâ€™s like an engineer walking into a project on Day 1 without access to Jira, repo history, or test results. The model may produce something *plausible*, but it wonâ€™t be *reliable*.

Thatâ€™s where **context aggregation** comes in.

## Definition

**Context aggregation** is the process of **collecting, structuring, and compressing all the relevant signals** that an AI system needs to make informed, accurate decisions.

Instead of feeding the model raw text from a single file, we build a pipeline that gives it a **360Â° view of the problem**.

## Examples in the SDLC

Imagine youâ€™re asking an AI agent to fix a failing build. What context does it need?

* **Jira Tickets** â€“ Why the work item exists, business priority, acceptance criteria.
* **Repo History** â€“ Past commits, conventions, and related changes.
* **Test Failures** â€“ Logs that show where things are breaking.
* **CI/CD Pipelines** â€“ The exact step where the build failed.
* **Compliance Rules** â€“ Security or coding policies that cannot be violated.

By combining these, the AI can propose a fix that is not only syntactically correct, but **aligned with the system, the team, and the business.**

## Why It Matters

* **Reduces hallucinations** â€“ The model isnâ€™t guessing in the dark.
* **Improves adoption** â€“ Developers trust AI more when outputs are grounded.
* **Scales better** â€“ Context pipelines can serve multiple agents and workflows.

## ðŸ’¡ **Takeaway**

Context aggregation is not about dumping more data into a model. Itâ€™s about giving AI **the right data, at the right time, in the right shape.**

In the next piece, weâ€™ll dive into the **patterns of context aggregation**â€”from simple retrieval to enterprise-scale pipelines.

I open-sourced a tiny demo (3 files) showing end-to-end context â†’ prompt â†’ diff â†’ patch.

If you were building a context pipeline today, what **signal** would you consider most critical for your teamâ€™s workflow?
